// for backwards compatibility fastjet/ClusterSequenceWithArea.hh
// provides the ClusterSequenceWithArea class that is equivalent to
// ClusterSequenceArea. The latter should now be used together with
// the fastjet/ClusterSequenceArea.hh. ClusterSequenceWithArea is not
// guaranteed to work in future release of FastJet
#warning You have included fastjet/ClusterSequenceWithArea.hh, \
a deprecated FastJet header provided only for backward compatibility. \
This is not guaranteed to work in future releases of FastJet. \
Please consider including fastjet/ClusterSequenceArea.hh directly. \
Similarily, if you use the (deprecated) class ClusterSequenceWithArea, \
please switch to the equivalent ClusterSequenceArea instead.
