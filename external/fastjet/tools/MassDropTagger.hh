/// @ingroup tools_taggers
/// \class MassDropTagger
/// Class that helps perform 2-pronged boosted tagging using
/// the "mass-drop" technique (with asymmetry cut) introduced by Jonathan
/// Butterworth, Adam Davison, Mathieu Rubin and Gavin Salam in
/// arXiv:0802.2470 in the context of a boosted Higgs search.
///
/// The tagger proceeds as follows:
///
///  0. start from a jet obtained from with the Cambridge/Aachen
///     algorithm
///
///  1. undo the last step of the clustering step j -> j1 + j2 (label
///     them such as j1 is the most massive).
///  
///  2. if there is a mass drop, i.e. m_j1/m_j < mu_cut, and the
///     splitting is sufficiently symmetric, \f${\rm
///     min}(p_{tj1}^2,p_{tj2}^2)\Delta R_{j1,j2}^2 > y_{\rm cut}
///     m_j^2\f$, keep j as the result of the tagger (with j1 and j2
///     its 2 subjets)
///
///  3. otherwise, redefine j to be equal to j1 and return to step 1.
///
/// Note that in the original proposal, j1 and j2 are both required
/// to be b-tagged and a filter (with Rfilt=min(0.3,Rbb/2) and
/// n_filt=3) is also applied to j to obtain the final "Higgs candidate".
/// See the example \subpage Example12 for details.
///
/// \section desc Options
/// 
/// The constructor has the following arguments:
///  - The first argument is the minimal mass drop that is required (mu_cut) [0.67
///    by default]
///  - The second argument is the asymmetry cut (y_cut) [0.09 by default]
///
/// \section input Input conditions
/// 
///  - one must be able to successively "uncluster" the original jet
///    using "has_parents"
///
/// \section output Output/structure
/// 
///  - the 2 subjets are kept as pieces if some substructure is found,
///    otherwise a single 0-momentum piece is returned
///  - the 'mu' and 'y' values corresponding to the unclustering step
///    that passed the tagger's cuts
///
/// See also \subpage Example12  for a usage example.
