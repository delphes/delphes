/// \class Pruner
/// Transformer that prunes a jet
///
/// This transformer prunes a jet according to the ideas presented in 
/// arXiv:0903.5081 (S.D. Ellis, C.K. Vermilion and J.R. Walsh). 
/// 
/// The jet's constituents are reclustered with a user-specified jet
/// definition, with the modification that objects i and j are only
/// recombined if at least one of the following two criteria is
/// satisfied:
///
///  - the geometric distance between i and j is smaller than 'Rcut'
///    with Rcut = Rcut_factor*2m/pt (Rcut_factor is a parameter of
///    the Pruner and m and pt obtained from the jet being pruned)
///  - the transverse momenta of i and j are at least 'zcut' p_t(i+j)
///
/// If both these criteria fail, i and j are not recombined, the 
/// harder of i and j is kept, and the softer is rejected. 
///
/// Usage: 
/// \code
///    Pruner pruner(jet_def, zcut, Rcut_factor);
///    PseudoJet pruned_jet = pruner(jet);
/// \endcode
///
/// The pruned_jet has a valid associated cluster sequence. In addition
/// the subjets of the original jet that have been vetoed by pruning
/// (i.e. have been 'pruned away') can be accessed using
///
/// \code
///   vector<PseudoJet> rejected_subjets = pruned_jet.structure_of<Pruner>().rejected();
/// \endcode
///
/// If the re-clustering happens to find more than a single inclusive
/// jet (this should normally not happen if the radius of the jet
/// definition used for the reclustering was set large enough),
/// the hardest of these jets is retured as the result of the
/// Pruner. The other jets can be accessed through
///
/// \code
///   vector<PseudoJet> extra_jets = pruned_jet.structure_of<Pruner>().extra_jets();
/// \endcode
///
/// Instead of using Rcut_factor and zcut, one can alternatively
/// construct a Pruner by passing two (pointers to) functions of 
/// PseudoJet that dynamically compute the Rcut and zcut to 
/// be used for the jet being pruned.
///
/// When the jet being pruned has area support and explicit ghosts,
/// the resulting pruned jet will likewise have area.
