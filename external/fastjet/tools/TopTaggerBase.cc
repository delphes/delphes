// compute the W helicity angle
//
// The helicity angle is a standard observable in top decays, used to
// determine the Lorentz structure of the top- W coupling [13]. It is
// defined as the angle, measured in the rest frame of the
// reconstructed W, between the reconstructed top's flight direction
// and one of the W decay products. Normally, it is studied in
// semi-leptonic top decays, where the charge of the lepton uniquely
// identifies these decay products. In hadronic top decays there is an
// ambiguity which we resolve by choosing the lower pT subjet, as
// measured in the lab frame.
//
// The jet passed to this function is expected to already have
// the structure of a top, including a functional "W()" call;
// the W must be made of two pieces.
