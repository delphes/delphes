/// A transformer, when it acts on a jet, returns a modified version
/// of that jet, one that may have a different momentum and/or
/// different internal structure.

/// \code
///   SomeTransformer transformer(...);
///   PseudoJet transformed_jet = transformer(original_jet);
///   // or
///   vector<PseudoJet> transformed_jets = transformer(original_jets);
/// \endcode
///
/// For many transformers, the transformed jets have
/// transformer-specific information that can be accessed through the
///
/// \code
///   transformed_jet.structure_of<SomeTransformer>().transformer_specific_info();
/// \endcode
///
/// See the description of the Filter class for a more detailed usage
/// example. See the FastJet manual to find out how to implement
/// new transformers.
