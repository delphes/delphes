/// \class Filter
/// Class that helps perform filtering (Butterworth, Davison, Rubin
/// and Salam, arXiv:0802.2470) and trimming (Krohn, Thaler and Wang,
/// arXiv:0912.1342) on jets, optionally in conjunction with
/// subtraction (Cacciari and Salam, arXiv:0707.1378).
///
/// For example, to apply filtering that reclusters a jet's
/// constituents with the Cambridge/Aachen jet algorithm with R=0.3
/// and then selects the 3 hardest subjets, one can use the following
/// code:
/// \code
///    Filter filter(JetDefinition(cambridge_algorithm, 0.3), SelectorNHardest(3));
///    PseudoJet filtered_jet = filter(original_jet);
/// \endcode
///
/// To obtain trimming, involving for example the selection of all
/// subjets carrying at least 3% of the original jet's pt, the
/// selector would be replaced by SelectorPtFractionMin(0.03).
///
/// To additionally perform subtraction on the subjets prior to
/// selection, either include a 3rd argument specifying the background
/// density rho, or call the set_subtractor(...) member function.  If
/// subtraction is requested, the original jet must be the result of a
/// clustering with active area with explicit ghosts support or a
/// merging of such pieces.
///
/// The information on the subjets that were kept and rejected can be
/// obtained using:
/// \code
///    vector<PseudoJet> kept_subjets = filtered_jet.pieces();
///    vector<PseudoJet> rejected_subjets = filtered_jet.structure_of<Filter>().rejected();
/// \endcode
///
/// \section impl Implementation Note
/// 
/// If the original jet was defined with the Cambridge/Aachen
/// algorithm (or is made of pieces each of which comes from the C/A
/// alg) and the filtering definition is C/A, then the filter does not
/// rerun the C/A algorithm on the constituents, but instead makes use
/// of the existent C/A cluster sequence in the original jet. This
/// increases the speed of the filter. 
///
/// See also \subpage Example11 for a further usage example.
///
/// Support for areas, reuse of C/A cluster sequences, etc.,
/// considerably complicates the implementation of Filter. For an
/// explanation of how a simpler filter might be coded, see the
/// "User-defined transformers" appendix of the manual.
