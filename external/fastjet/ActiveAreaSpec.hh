// for backwards compatibility fastjet/ActiveAreaSpec.hh provides the
// ActiveAreSpec class that is equivalent to GhostedAreaSpec. The
// latter should now be used (defined in the
// fastjet/GhostedAreaSpec.hh header). ActiveAreaSpec is not
// guaranteed to work in future release of FastJet
#warning This file includes fastjet/ActiveAreaSpec.hh, \
a deprecated FastJet header provided only for backward compatibility. \
This is not guaranteed to work in future releases of FastJet. \
Please consider including fastjet/GhostedAreaSpec.hh directly. \
Similarily, if you use the (deprecated) class ActiveAreaSpec, \
please switch to the equivalent GhostedAreaSpec instead.


#include "fastjet/GhostedAreaSpec.hh"

// NB: ActiveAreaSpec is left over from FJ 2.0 and 2.1;
//     In FJ 2.3 and 2.4 it was just typedefed to GhostedAreaSpec.
//     That's still the case in FJ 3.0, but the typedef has moved
//     from this header into the GhostedAreaSpec.hh header. This way,
//     anyone including ActiveAreaSpec.hh will get a deprecated warning, but
//     people who relied on getting ActiveAreaSpec indirectly will not 
//     have their code broken.
