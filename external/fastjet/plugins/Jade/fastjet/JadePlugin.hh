/// JadePlugin is a plugin for fastjet (v2.4 upwards)
/// It implements the JADE algorithm, which is an e+e- sequential
/// recombination algorithm with interparticle distance
///
///   dij = 2 E_i E_j (1 - cos theta_ij)
///
/// or equivalently
///
///   yij = dij/E_{vis}^2                
///
/// This corresponds to the distance measured used in 
///
///   "Experimental Investigation of the Energy Dependence of the Strong Coupling Strength."
///   JADE Collaboration (S. Bethke et al.)
///   Phys.Lett.B213:235,1988
///
/// The JADE article carries out particle recombinations in the
/// E-scheme (4-vector recombination), which is the default procedure for this 
/// plugin.
///
/// NOTE: other widely used schemes include E0, P, P0; however they also 
///       involve modifications to the distance measure. Be sure of
///       what you're doing before running a JADE type algorithm.
///
/// To access the jets with a given ycut value (clustering stops once
/// all yij > ycut), use
///
///   vector<PseudoJet> jets = cluster_sequence.exclusive_jets_ycut(ycut);
///
/// and related routines.
