-------------------------
Version 2
-------------------------

This is a streamlining of the N-subjettiness code, developed mainly by TJ
Wilkason.  The core functionality is unchanged, but classes have been
dramatically reorganized to allow for later expansion.  Because the API for
Njettiness has changed, we have called this v2 (http://semver.org).

Note that we have maintain backwards compatibility for the typical ways that
Nsubjettiness was used.  In particular, all of the Nsubjettiness class code in
the example file v1.0.3 from still compiles, as does the NjettinessPlugin class
code that uses the default measure.

The key new features are:

  * NsubjettinessRatio:  Direct access to tau_N / tau_M (the most requested
    feature)
  * MeasureDefinition to allow access to both normalized and unnormalized measures
  * AxesDefinition to allow for access to more general axes modes
  * Winner-Take-All recombination axes:  a faster way to find axes than beta = 1
    minimization, but with comparable performance.
  * TauComponents to get access to the pieces of the N-(sub)jettiness
    calculation.
  * For clarity, split the example file into an example_basic_usage and
    example_advanced_usage
  * In Nsubjettiness, access to seedAxes() and currentAxes() to figure out the
    axes used before and after minimization.
  * In Nsubjettiness, access to currentSubjets() to get the subjet fourvectors.


-- 2.1.0:  (July 9, 2014) Inclusion of MeasureDefinition/AxesDefinition interface.
           This was the first publicly available version of Nsubjettiness v2.
-- 2.0.0:  Initial release of v2.0.  This was never officially made public.

-------------------------
Version 1
-------------------------

This was a new release using FastJet contrib framework, primary developed by
Jesse Thaler.

-- 1.0.3:  Added inlines to fix compile issue (thanks Matthew Low)
-- 1.0.2:  Fixed potential dependency issue (thanks FJ authors)
-- 1.0.1:  Fixed memory leak in Njettiness.hh (thanks FJ authors)
-- 1.0.0:  New release using FastJet contrib framework.  This includes a new
makefile and a simplified example program.

Previous Versions
-------------------------

The previous versions of this code were developed initially by Ken Van Tilburg,
tweaked by Jesse Thaler, and made into a robust FastJet add on by Chris
Vermilion.

Previous versions available from:
   http://jthaler.net/jets/Njettiness-0.5.1.tar.gz (Experimental Version)
   http://jthaler.net/jets/Njettiness-0.4.1.tar.gz (Stable Version)

Previous version history:
-- 0.5.1:  For Njettiness Plugin, added access to currentTau values and axes via
           ClusterSequence::Extras class.  (thanks to Dinko Ferencek and John
           Paul Chou)
-- 0.5.0:  Corrected fatal error in ConstituentTauValue (TauValue unaffected).
           Started process of allowing for more general measures and alternative
           minimization schemes. Extremely preliminary inclusion of alternative
           "geometric" measure.
-- 0.4.1:  Corrected bug where a too-small value of Rcut would cause the
           minimization procedure to fail (thanks Marat Freytsis, Brian Shuve)
-- 0.4.0:  Adding Nsubjettiness FunctionOfPseudoJet<float>.  Re-organizing file
           structure and doing some re-naming to clarify Njettiness vs.
           Nsubjettiness.  Some speedup in UpdateAxes code. (CKV)
-- 0.3.2:  Returns zero instead of a segmentation fault when the number of
           particles in a jet is smaller than the N value in tau_N (thanks
           Grigory Ovanesyan)
-- 0.3.2:  Fixed -Wshadow errors (thanks Grigory Ovanesyan)
-- 0.3.1:  Fixed stray comma/semicolon compiler error (thanks Grigory Ovanesyan)
-- 0.3.1:  Corrected tarbomb issue (thanks Jonathan Walsh)
-- 0.3.1:  Added anti-kT seeds as option
-- 0.3.1:  Fixed bug in minimization code with R_cutoff (thanks Chris Vermilion)
-- 0.3.1:  Added getPartition() and getJets() functions as helper functions for
           Chris Vermilion. (JT)
