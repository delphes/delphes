/*
 * tclUnixPort.h --
 *
 *	This header file handles porting issues that occur because
 *	of differences between systems.  It reads in UNIX-related
 *	header files and sets up UNIX-related macros for Tcl's UNIX
 *	core.  It should be the only file that contains #ifdefs to
 *	handle different flavors of UNIX.  This file sets up the
 *	union of all UNIX-related things needed by any of the Tcl
 *	core files.  This file depends on configuration #defines such
 *	as NO_DIRENT_H that are set up by the "configure" script.
 *
 *	Much of the material in this file was originally contributed
 *	by Karl Lehenbauer, Mark Diekhans and Peter da Silva.
