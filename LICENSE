Fastjet
#####

Unknown Copyright. FastJet was written and is maintained and developed 
by Matteo Cacciari, Gavin P. Salam and Gregory Soyez

FastJet is released under the terms of the GNU General Public License
v2 (GPLv2). FastJet includes a significant body of third-party code,
for example for third party plugin algorithms and for computational
geometry methods. These too are usually released under the GPL or
permissive licenses.

*/NOTICE: Several files are part of FastJet and released with the following mention, 
thus explicitly allowing to use a later version than version 2 of the GNU GPL license:

//  FastJet is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
//  it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
//  the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
//  (at your option) any later version.
//
//  The algorithms that underlie FastJet have required considerable
//  development. They are described in the original FastJet paper,
//  hep-ph/0512210 and in the manual, arXiv:1111.6097. If you use
//  FastJet as part of work towards a scientific publication, please
//  quote the version you use and include a citation to the manual and
//  optionally also to hep-ph/0512210.
//
//  FastJet is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
//  but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
//  MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
//  GNU General Public License for more details.
//
//  You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
//  along with FastJet. If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

Nearly all depedencies of FastJet are released with the same mention thus
also explicitly allowing to use a later version than version 2 of the GNU GPL license:
"... either version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version..."

Finally, we have received express autorisations to release the only dependencies under
GNU GPL v2: D0 RunI and RunII cone plugins and ATLAScone code, 
under GNU GPL v3 or later license. Specifically, 
  - we received agreement from Joey Huston <Huston@pa.msu.edu> to distribute the ATLAScone code under GPL v3 or later;
  - we received agreement from Paul Grannis for the D0 collaboration to distribute the D0 RunI and RunII cone plugins under GPL v3 or later.

To: Christophe Delaere <christophe.delaere@cern.ch>, Dmitri Denisov <denisovd@fnal.gov>, Paul Grannis <pgrannis@fnal.gov>
Subject: Re: D0 cone license

Dear Christophe,

This is to explicitly give you permission to license the D0 jet code for the GPLv3 release and subsequent future releases.

    with best regards,
    Dmitri Denisov and Paul Grannis
    co-spokespersons of DZero
