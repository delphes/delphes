Delphes 4 LHCb
==============

The card "delphes_card_LHCb.tcl" contains a preliminary parametrization of the LHCb detector.

- ParticlePropagator

particles are propagated in a constant B field.

- ChargedHadronMomentumSmearing/ElectronEnergySmearing/MuonMomentumSmearing

charged particles momenta are smeared according to detector resolution

- TrackMerger

charged particles are merged into single collection for simpler future processing

- ImpactParameterSmearing

charged particles transverse IP are smeared according to known LHCb tracking
performance.


- IdentificationMap

This module is a recent addition in order to map particle misidentification rates
and reconstruction efficiencies.

An example is given in the card but can be expanded if needed.

- ECAL/HCAL

Calorimeter modules are used to parametrize the energy response and angular
resolution of neutral objects such as photons/neutral hadrons.

- TreeWriter

user specifies here which collections are stored in the output.
By default tracks, neutral hadrons and photons are stored in this card.
Tracks contain muons, electrons, and charged hadrons.
